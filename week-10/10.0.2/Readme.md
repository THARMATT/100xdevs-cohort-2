**Introduction to ORM/Prisma in TypeScript**

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that enables developers to work with relational databases using an object-oriented approach. Prisma is a modern ORM tool that simplifies database access and manipulation, particularly when working with TypeScript.

**ORM/Prisma**

ORM/Prisma serves as a bridge between the application code and the database, abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries and database operations. With Prisma, developers can define database models using TypeScript classes, making database interactions more intuitive and type-safe.

**Prisma Libraries**

Prisma provides a set of libraries that streamline database operations:

- **@prisma/client**: This library generates a client for TypeScript applications, allowing seamless communication with the database.
- **@prisma/cli**: The Prisma CLI offers commands for generating database migrations, managing schema, and performing other administrative tasks.
- **@prisma/migrate**: This library facilitates schema migrations, ensuring database changes are applied consistently across development environments.

**Building a Project**

To illustrate, let's create a simple project using Prisma in TypeScript. First, install Prisma and initialize a new project:

```bash
npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
npx prisma init
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project. Once initialized, define your database models in the `schema.prisma` file using Prisma's schema language.

```prisma
// schema.prisma

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  email     String   @unique
  posts     Post[]
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}
```

**Prisma Models**

Prisma models represent database entities and relationships. Each model corresponds to a database table, and fields define the table columns.

**Prisma Migration**

After defining models, generate and apply migrations to synchronize the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This command creates a migration named "init" based on the defined schema and applies it to the database.

**neon.tech for Postgres**

Neon.tech is a hosting service for PostgreSQL databases, providing a robust platform for deploying and managing database instances.

**Sending Queries to Your Database**

With the schema defined and migrations applied, use the generated Prisma client to send queries to the database:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
    include: {
      posts: true,
    },
  });
  console.log(users);
}

main()
  .catch((e) => {
    throw e;
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
```

This code retrieves all users from the database along with their associated posts.

**dub.sh**

Dub.sh is a shell script used for various purposes, including task automation and package management in TypeScript projects.
