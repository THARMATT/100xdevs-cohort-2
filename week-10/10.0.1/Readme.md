### üí° Introduction to SQL and NoSQL Databases Covered in the Class

In the realm of database management, two main paradigms stand out: SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases. These two approaches cater to different needs and use cases, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

**SQL Databases:**
SQL databases are based on the relational model and use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. They are organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using keys. Examples of SQL databases include PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and SQL Server.

**NoSQL Databases:**
NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store and retrieve data using methods other than the tabular relations used in SQL databases. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Redis.

**Example:**
Let's consider an e-commerce application. In an SQL database, you might have tables for customers, orders, products, etc., with clearly defined relationships between them. In a NoSQL database, you could store all customer-related information in a single document, making it easier to scale horizontally as the number of customers grows.

### üìä Detailed Discussion on SQL Databases and Their Types

SQL databases are categorized into different types based on their implementation and features:

1. **Relational Databases:** These databases organize data into tables with rows and columns, and they enforce a strict schema. Examples include PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle.

2. **Key-Value Stores:** These databases store data as a collection of key-value pairs. Examples include Redis, DynamoDB.

3. **Document Stores:** Data is stored in flexible, JSON-like documents. Examples include MongoDB, Couchbase.

4. **Column-Family Stores:** Data is stored in columns rather than rows. Examples include Cassandra, HBase.

5. **Graph Databases:** These databases are optimized for storing and querying relationships between data. Examples include Neo4j, Amazon Neptune.

**Example Code:**
```sql
-- Creating a table in PostgreSQL
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

-- Inserting data into the table
INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');

-- Retrieving data from the table
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Updating data in the table
UPDATE customers SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;

-- Deleting data from the table
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 1;
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Learning to Connect to PostgreSQL and Understanding its URL Structure

PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system. Connecting to PostgreSQL typically involves specifying connection details such as the host, port, username, password, and database name in a URL-like format.

**URL Structure:**
```
postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database
```

**Example Code:**
```python
import psycopg2

# Connection parameters
conn_params = {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": "5432",
    "database": "mydatabase",
    "user": "myuser",
    "password": "mypassword"
}

# Connecting to PostgreSQL
try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(**conn_params)
    print("Connected to PostgreSQL!")
except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error:
    print("Error while connecting to PostgreSQL:", error)
```

### üîÑ Exploring Various Types of Queries and their Implementation

SQL queries allow us to interact with databases, retrieve data, modify data, and perform various operations. Common types of SQL queries include:

1. **SELECT:** Retrieves data from one or more tables.
2. **INSERT:** Adds new rows of data into a table.
3. **UPDATE:** Modifies existing data in a table.
4. **DELETE:** Removes rows from a table.
5. **JOIN:** Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

**Example Code:**
```sql
-- Selecting data from multiple tables using a join
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```

### üìù Hands-on Experience in Creating Tables and Establishing Relationships with Foreign Keys

In relational databases, tables are created to store data, and relationships between tables are established using foreign keys.

**Example Code:**
```sql
-- Creating tables with foreign key relationships
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)
);
```

### üì• Inserting, Retrieving, Updating, and Deleting Data in PostgreSQL

These are fundamental operations performed on data within a PostgreSQL database:

**Example Code:**
```sql
-- Inserting data into the customers table
INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');

-- Retrieving data from the customers table
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Updating data in the customers table
UPDATE customers SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;

-- Deleting data from the customers table
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id = 1;
```

### üß© Understanding Advanced Concepts like Joins and Types of Joins

Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Common types of joins include:

1. **INNER JOIN:** Returns rows when there is at least one match in both tables.
2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):** Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table, NULL on the right side when there is no match.
3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):** Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table, NULL on the left side when there is no match.
4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):** Returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

**Example Code:**
```sql
-- Inner Join
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

-- Left Join
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

-- Right Join
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

-- Full Join
SELECT customers.name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
FULL JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```
